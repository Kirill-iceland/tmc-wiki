# Definition
The definition of a perimeter varies widely in the technical community, but it generally refers to either of the following:
1.  An area where no mobs can spawn with the player in a certain position  
2.  A hole (usually down to bedrock) at least 128 blocks in radius that achieves the same purpose
    1. This can also refer to holes that are dug that are not necessarily that radius, but still do not allow mob spawning because of the height at which the player may be.
    2. Holes that span across the entire render distance of a server are also considered perimeters, but are not made usually for cancelling all mob spawns. Instead, they are made for lag purposes. 
# Purpose
Perimeters are generally used for either improving the efficiency of farms, or for reducing lag. The first is achieved by making sure that no mobs can spawn other than inside the farm, therefore giving the farm the opportunity to reach its maximum rates. The second, is achieved by removing all blocks in the area in order to remove most causes of lag. The most common occurences of these types of perimeters are for the spawn chunks and other areas that are frequently loaded, such as main storages. Thirdly, and more rarely, perimeters are made soley for decorative purposes. While there are only a few examples of this, it is common to create a perimeter as a custom shape for decorative purposes, but still hold a farm inside. 
# Creation
While there are many ways to create a perimeter, over time it has evolved to boil down to two main methods: using a world eater, or digging by hand. World eaters are large flying machines that duplicate TNT and simultaneously clear liquids, which leads to the perimeter-making process being almost fully automated (obsidian removal is still necessary). On the other hand, digging by hand is exactly as the name suggests: players use pickaxes and haste (not needed in the nether) in order to clear out the area. Using speed beacons is common, and collecting items is the usual. While there are many advantages to both, the main argument for digging is that TNT duplication is a cheaty mechanic and is overpowered. Other methods include: using TNT dispenser grids; using quarries; using three way flying machines with TNT duplicators attached; using many two way flying machines with TNT duplicators attached- effectively just world eaters without the sweepers; a mix of both world eaters and hand digging in order to achieve a custom shape.
