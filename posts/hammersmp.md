# Projects
HammerSMP has many notable projects and many others in the working. The most notable is probably [End Of Light (EOL)](https://youtu.be/0ZiU_pcmoEE). EOL uses light suppression was originally discovered by Kayleigh, but made survival friendly by HammerSMP and made into useable mob farms.
EOL provides the fastest mob farms with rates going up to 4 mil items / h not barring lag on a single mobcap. EOL is possible with the following mob farms:
- General mob farm
- Spider Farm
- Skeleton Farm
- Drowned Farm
- Witch Farm
- Bat Farm

HammerSMP has made the fastest 1.15.0-1.16.0 [iron farm](https://youtu.be/6SxxmhF8Kk4) using end gateway unloading discovered by vktec.
Hammer also has made the current fastest 1 player dual guardian farm with a rate of 1.8 mil items/h and the fastest slime farm with a rate of 1.65 mil items/h.

Hammer also discovered the only 8x portal glitch in minecraft 1.14+ called [Project Stargate](https://youtu.be/hZRg4udn96c). This is done by making the player go in both the end and nether in the same game tick.

HammerSMP also has open-source projects. These are projects where everything is openly available to everyone from the community and anyone can contribute.
The only open-source project at the moment is Project EnderCHest. Project EnderCHest is an advanced item storage network for the purpose of exploring the integration of computing and physical coding with item storage to allow the system to be built once and then never touched while having the contents accessible anywhere in the world and in survival.

HammerSMP is also developing 4-wide and 3-way bedrock breakers for minecraft 1.13+.

Furthermore, some HammerSMP members also develop mods and tools for minecraft.
